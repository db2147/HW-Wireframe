In this project, I built a web design skeleton using HTML/CSS.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was very helpful to learn about positioning, as well how HTML and CSS work together. &nbsp;&nbsp;I got a lot of practice using the inspect tool which proved very helpful when sizing my layout.  It was much more efficient to work with sizing margins for example in the browser, than going back to the html file and deploying each time.
