# Wireframe Project

In this assignment, I built a web design skeleton using HTML/CSS. It was very helpful to learn about positioning, as well as HTML and CSS. I got a lot of practice using the inspect tool in the chrome browser which proved very helpful when sizing my layout.  

When constructing this project, I created my index.html file first, then started to integrate the CSS into it.<img src="images\css-3-logo-AF06D75231-seeklogo.com.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 110px; float: left;" /> The fun thing about this is there is one page of CSS which styles all three html pages which is a great time saver when creating a website.
